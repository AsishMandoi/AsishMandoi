### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Asish, a 3rd-year undergrad at IIT Kanpur, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.

My field of interest includes Software Development and Quantum Computing. I have programming experience of over two years. I have been engaged in exciting technologies in the two domains throughout the last 2+ years as a student.

Currently, I'm working on solving optimization problems using Quantum Computing, a fast-growing and promising field that performs computations fundamentally differently from the way they have been performed till now. I continue to explore fascinating domains in Science and Engineering, as well as technologies that can potentially change how we live.

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asish-mandoi-4178581b4/) or [email](mailto:luckyasish13@gmail.com) me if you find any common interests, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about anything.
